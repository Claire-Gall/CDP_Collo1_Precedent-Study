    Rafael Lozano-Hemmer is a Mexican-Canadian artist deeply embedded in the exploration of technology as it intersects with spatial dynamics, architecture and public engagement. His work integrates tools of surveillance, robotics, alongside live performance to create immersive experiences that engage audiences in somewhat startling ways. To Hemmer, the body is always in process within physical space. He grounds his practice in an expanded view of architecture as an architecture of social relations, surveillance and temporary exceptions to this rule, which he is curious to activate and provide opportunity for people to explore. His work often circulates themes of memory, identity, the body and the socio-political implications of technology. He views architecture in the context of the social dynamics it creates which is why his work is deeply curious with visitor activity and the somewhat random nature by which guests move about a space, aided by his artwork. At times, his work, such as Under Scan has prompted certain audiences to react in unexpected ways to the piece, be it by bonding with strangers or the space in ways that couldn't have been predicted by the artist and his team.

    <p>
"Voz Alta" and "Under Scan", the two works that I've chosen to inform my precedent study are both from his Relational Architecture series, spanning 21 works in total. A thematic he deploys in each of these pieces is circularity. In Voz Alta, auditory-space loops. With every participant, their voice or physical movement becomes logged and shared as the piece continues. This creates an archived log of a spatial experience, digitized.

In a talk he gave at the San Francisco MOMA, Lozano-Hemmer shares, "Art should help us mourn, but it should also help us signal continuity".

          Voz Alta (Loud Voice) (Relational Architecture 15) is a live installation memorializing a student massacre that took place in in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in Mexico City's Tlateloloco housing complex, on October 2nd, 1968. Students and others gathered in the plaza demanding a democratization of Mexico's political system, this being seen as an act of treason and sobotage towards the state by government officials Interior Minister Luis Echeverria and President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz. This massacre severely ruptured Mexico's political sphere, with the aftermath resulting in varying degrees of political polarity still felt today. Commissioned by UNAM University, Rafael Lozano-Hemmer designed this functional prototype of a megaphone that amplifies people's voices as powerful beams of light hit the Ministry of Foreign Affairs which then triggered three additional light beams to illuminate paths over Mexico City. Archival materials were emitted through the megaphone along with live visitor statements as beams cascaded over Mexico City in rhythm with the sound of the broadcast. All sound was also channeled through to a radio broadcast so whether on or offsite, patrons could listen and experience the sound/space continuum of memory Lozano-Hemmer's piece created. Lozano-Hemmer has always been deeply curious about precedents of technological art, including the Estridentista poets, who launched radio broadcasting in Mexico in the 1920s. This piece in it's form pays tribute to the origins of this technology as a practice of public-facing art and expression in Mexico.

      Under Scan (Relational Architecture 11) uses surveillance technology as a subversive technique, creating vantage points that offer visitors novel perspectives on their surroundings and potential touchpoints for connection. This piece preceded Voz Alta and was activated throughout public spaces in the United Kingdom. The piece began through collecting 1000 videos of volunteers who were invited to act however they'd like infront of the camera, with a few points of direction to look into the camera and then look away, the eventual touchpoint for participants in the piece once realized in physical space ranging from 1,000-2,000 sq. meter areas. A highly powerful projector, of 100,000 lumens, casted pedestrians shadows into public spaces in 5 towns in the United Kingdom. Within the shadows, a computer tracking system projected live video portraits of human beings, who were all volunteers and pre-recorded. The visitor's shadow is captured and momentarily replaced with another person to percieve as they become situated in the physical space. It is an intriging question to ask how shadow-casting and the active tracking of participant's as they walk around the square calls to issues of surveillance, however, in this instance, it is for the sake of play.
    </p>
    <p>
      The piece was informed by the French concept mise en abyme, which literally refers to a story placed within a story or an element placed within another element adding a sequencing effect. In this piece, the video participant's image is placed within the shadow of the live participant in a continuous manner.
